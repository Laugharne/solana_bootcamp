# [](https://youtu.be/EwaKX5YoIjk?t=0) Introduction to Working with Tokens in Solana

Section Overview: In this section, Jacob Creech introduces the topic of working with tokens in Solana and discusses the purpose of a staking program.

## Understanding Staking Programs

- A staking program allows users to deposit tokens and earn rewards based on the duration of their stake.
- Staking programs have various applications, such as in-game mechanics where longer participation leads to greater rewards.

## Designing the Stake Program

- Before building a program on Solana, it is important to plan and identify the necessary accounts.
- The user will have a wallet and a specific PDA (Program Derived Address) called the gold token account.
- The stake program requires a user stake account for users to deposit gold tokens into.
- A stake info account is needed to track information about each user's stake, including slot time for reward generation.
- The stake program also requires a gold token vault account from which rewards are generated.

## Best Practices for Account Structure

- Some developers create a separate signing PDA for token accounts off of a program. However, this is not recommended.
- Instead, it is better to make the gold token vault account its own authority and use the PDA off of the state program to sign transfers for itself.

# [02:37](https://youtu.be/EwaKX5YoIjk?t=157) Creating Accounts for the Stake Program

Section Overview: In this section, Jacob Creech explains how to create different accounts required for running the stake program.

## User Accounts

- Users have wallets and possess a PDA called the gold token account.

## Stake Program Accounts

- The stake program requires a user stake account where users can deposit their gold tokens. This account is derived using "stake info" plus "user Pub Key".
- A stake info account is created to store information about each user's stake, such as slot time for reward generation.
- The gold token vault account is used to generate rewards and is derived using "Vault" plus "user Pub Key".

## Simplifying Account Structure

- It is possible to use the gold token vault account itself as the authority for signing transfers, eliminating the need for an additional signing PDA.

# [05:26](https://youtu.be/EwaKX5YoIjk?t=326) Summary of Required Accounts for the Stake Program

Section Overview: In this section, Jacob Creech summarizes all the necessary accounts required to run the stake program.

## Required Accounts

- User Token Account: Owned by the user and holds their gold tokens.
- User Stake Account: Created by the stake program to receive deposited gold tokens from users.
- Stake Info Account: Stores information about each user's stake, including slot time for reward generation.
- Gold Token Vault Account: Generates rewards for the stake program.

Note: It is important to correctly associate seeds and keys with each account to ensure security and prevent unauthorized access.


# [07:22](https://youtu.be/EwaKX5YoIjk?t=442) Initializing the Anchor Project

Section Overview: In this section, the speaker explains how to initialize a new Anchor project and sets up the necessary files for the staking program.

## Initializing the Anchor Project

- Use the command `Anchor init` to initialize a new Anchor project.
- Name the project "staking program".
- The project will have an "app" folder for storing the front-end (not used in this case).
- The main file of the project is `lib.rs`, which contains an initial function and test cases.

# [08:06](https://youtu.be/EwaKX5YoIjk?t=486) Version Compatibility

Section Overview: This section discusses the required versions of Solana CLI and Anchor for this tutorial.

## Version Compatibility

- Ensure that you are using Solana CLI version 1.16.0.
- If you are not using Anchor version 28 or Solana CLI 1.16.0, update your versions to ensure compatibility with this program.

# [09:10](https://youtu.be/EwaKX5YoIjk?t=550) Building and Compiling

Section Overview: This section covers building and compiling the code to check for any issues or warnings.

## Building and Compiling

- Run `anchor build` to build the code.
- Check for any warnings during compilation.
- Some warnings may indicate unused parameters, but they can be ignored for now as they will be used in future steps.

# [09:49](https://youtu.be/EwaKX5YoIjk?t=589) Setting Up Constants

Section Overview: Here, constants related to seeds are defined for later use in the program.

## Setting Up Constants

- Create a public module called `constants`.
- Define three constants:
  - `Vault seed`: Set it as `"vault"`.
  - `Stake info seed`: Set it as `"stake_info"`.
  - `Token seed`: Set it as `"token"`.

# [11:15](https://youtu.be/EwaKX5YoIjk?t=675) Scaffolding the Program

Section Overview: This section explains the process of scaffolding the program by defining the necessary instructions and functions.

## Scaffolding the Program

- Define three main instructions or functions for the program:
  - `initialize`: Initializes the program and creates necessary accounts.
  - `stake`: Allows users to stake a specific amount.
  - `de-stake`: Removes stake, provides rewards, resets stake info, and returns balance from stake account.

# [13:08](https://youtu.be/EwaKX5YoIjk?t=788) Initializing Accounts

Section Overview: Here, the speaker discusses initializing accounts required for the staking program.

## Initializing Accounts

- Create an account for `gold token Vault` using `init_if_needed`.
- Use seeds (`Vault seed`) and a signer (`pair`) to initialize the account.
# [14:33](https://youtu.be/EwaKX5YoIjk?t=873) Setting up the Lifetime Perfect

Section Overview: In this section, the speaker discusses setting up the lifetime perfect and explains the different components involved.

## Setting up the Account and Token Mint

- The pair is referencing the account of signer.
- Two other important things are the token mint and token authority.
- The account will be public, while the token vault will be a type of account info token account.

## Understanding Authority and Mint

- To sign for the transfer, one needs to have authority.
- The mint is required for managing token accounts within programs.
- Other necessary accounts include public mint, token program, and system program.

## Initializing Accounts

- All necessary information for initializing accounts is provided.
- The token vault account is initialized on startup.

# [16:48](https://youtu.be/EwaKX5YoIjk?t=1008) Handling Errors in Code

Section Overview: This section focuses on addressing errors encountered during code execution.

## Running into Errors

- When building with `anchor build`, there are several errors related to unused code from tokens and missing features like `init if needed`.
- These errors need to be resolved before proceeding.

## Fixing Errors Step by Step

1. Add a semicolon that was missing in the code.
2. Include `init if needed` feature by updating `anchor-lang` version in Cargo.toml file.
3. Resolve error related to missing `sbl-token` or `anchor-svl` by adding them as dependencies in Cargo.toml file.
4. Import necessary modules using `use` statements to resolve missing module errors.

# [19:36](https://youtu.be/EwaKX5YoIjk?t=1176) Testing Initialization Functionality

Section Overview: This section emphasizes testing the initialization functionality of the code.

## Importance of Testing Initialization Functionality

- It is crucial to test initialization functionality before proceeding further to avoid potential issues.

## Running the Test

- Use `anchor test` command to run a local validator on the test.
- To speed up the process, skip the local validator setup by adding `[skip-local-validator]` flag.

# [20:38](https://youtu.be/EwaKX5YoIjk?t=1238) Running Solidity Test Validator

Section Overview: This section explains how to run a Solidity test validator for testing purposes.

## Running Solidity Test Validator

- Run `solana-test-validator` in the background to set up a Solidity test validator.
- This allows for faster testing and validation of code functionality.
# [21:27](https://youtu.be/EwaKX5YoIjk?t=1287) Including All Required Accounts for Transaction

Section Overview: In this section, the speaker emphasizes the importance of including all the necessary accounts for a transaction. They mention that a specific account called "token Vault account" was not included and highlight the need to include it.

## Creating Required Accounts

- To proceed with the transaction, certain accounts need to be created.
- The required accounts are:
  - Vault
  - Mint (to create token accounts off the vault)
  
## Setting Up Dependencies

- The speaker mentions using mocha and includes `yarn add @solana/spl-token` to install SPL token.
- They also mention having Coral anchor and web3.js already set up.

## Initializing RPC Call

- The current code initializes an RPC call but does not provide any of the required accounts.
- The speaker sets up a provider and pair using `anchor.provider.env` and `provider.wallet as anchor.wallet`.
- A connection is established using `new connection('http://127.0.0.1:8899')`.

## Creating Mint Token Account

- An async function named "create mint token" is defined.
- This function creates a mint token account using `await createMint()` from SPL token library.
- Various parameters such as connection, payer's public key, decimals, etc., are passed while creating the mint.

## Generating Key Pair for Mint

- A key pair named "mint key pair" is generated to ensure consistency throughout tests.
- This key pair is used to create the mint account.

## Logging Mint Information

- The generated mint account information is logged using `console.log(mint)`.

## Creating Vault Account

- As part of running tests, a vault account needs to be created.
- Since it's a PDA (Program Derived Address), it needs to be created based on certain criteria.

# [26:38](https://youtu.be/EwaKX5YoIjk?t=1598) Creating Vault Account

# [35:12](https://youtu.be/EwaKX5YoIjk?t=2112) Creating Token and Stake Accounts

Section Overview: In this section, the speaker discusses the creation of token and stake accounts for a program. They explain that there are three types of accounts needed: stake info account, user stake account, and user token account.

## Creating the Token Account

- The speaker mentions that they need to create a token account for the user.
- This account is not created within the program but on the client side.
- The token account needs to be mutable as funds or tokens will be moved from this account.
- It should be associated with a specific mint and have an associated token authority.
- The signer for this account is the user themselves.

## Importing Associated Token Program

- The speaker explains that since there is an associated token account, they need to import the associated token program.
- They mention that it needs to be included in the program's dependencies to avoid errors.

# [37:37](https://youtu.be/EwaKX5YoIjk?t=2257) Implementing Staking Logic

## Handling Different Scenarios

- The speaker mentions that they want to handle various scenarios related to staking.
- These scenarios include cases where a user has already staked tokens or has no tokens to stake.
- They also mention considering future de-staking scenarios where someone tries to de-stake without having any tokens staked.

## Creating Error Codes

- To handle these scenarios, error codes are created within the program.
- Three error codes are mentioned:
  - "Tokens are already staked" - for when a user tries to stake while already having staked tokens
  - "Tokens are not staked" - for when a user tries to de-stake without having any tokens staked
  - "No tokens to stake" - for when a user tries to stake without having any tokens

## Implementing Staking Logic

- The speaker starts implementing the staking logic within the program.
- They mention that they need to access the stake info account and make it immutable as they will be changing its information during staking.
- They discuss using conditional statements to handle different scenarios and return the corresponding error codes if necessary.
