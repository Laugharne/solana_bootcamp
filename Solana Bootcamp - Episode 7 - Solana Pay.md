# [06:19](https://youtu.be/v88C0jL8pTQ?t=379) Transfer Request for SBO Token

Section Overview: This section explains the transfer request process for an SBO token, including the optional fields and the importance of the reference or UUID.

## Transfer Request Process

- A transfer request can be made for an SBO token, which is optional as Native Soul can also be used.
- The transfer request includes the token mint, label, message, and an optional memo.
- The reference or UUID is crucial as it acts as a unique identifier to link the transaction happening on a store or point of sale system with the on-chain transaction.

# [06:36](https://youtu.be/v88C0jL8pTQ?t=396) Importance of Reference in Transfer Request

Section Overview: This section emphasizes the significance of the reference or UUID in connecting commerce transactions with on-chain transactions.

## Significance of Reference

- The reference or UUID connects commerce transactions with on-chain transactions.
- It serves as a randomly generated public key that should only be used once.
- The reference allows wallets supporting Solana Pay to decode QR codes and retrieve necessary parameters for the transfer request.

# [07:24](https://youtu.be/v88C0jL8pTQ?t=444) Wallet Support for Solana Pay

Section Overview: This section discusses wallets that currently support Solana Pay and their compatibility with scanning QR codes.

## Wallet Compatibility

- Wallets that support Solana Pay can decode QR codes encoded with transfer request URLs.
- Scanning such QR codes enables wallets to extract necessary parameters for processing transfers.
- Users need to ensure their chosen wallet supports Solana Pay before initiating transfers.

# [07:34](https://youtu.be/v88C0jL8pTQ?t=454) Transaction Requests in Solana Pay V2

Section Overview: This section introduces transaction requests in Solana Pay V2, which allow users to construct any valid Solana transaction.

## Transaction Requests

- In Solana Pay V2, users can construct any valid Solana transaction using transaction requests.
- Transaction requests are still URL-based but point to the user's server, which needs to respond to both GET and POST requests.
- Wallets make two requests (GET and POST) to the server upon scanning the QR code.
- The GET request expects a response with an icon and label for display purposes.
- The POST request includes the account address of the person who scanned the QR code.
- The server must respond with a valid transaction based on the received POST request.

# [09:06](https://youtu.be/v88C0jL8pTQ?t=546) Creating Valid Transactions in Solana Pay

Section Overview: This section explains how servers can create valid transactions upon receiving POST requests from wallets.

## Creating Valid Transactions

- Upon receiving a POST request, servers need to respond with a valid transaction.
- This process was demonstrated earlier in the workshop when scanning a QR code caused an interaction with the Seven Seas program.
- Servers have flexibility in creating various types of transactions beyond payments.

# [09:46](https://youtu.be/v88C0jL8pTQ?t=586) Setting Up Project Directories

Section Overview: This section covers setting up project directories for following along with the workshop.

## Project Directory Setup

- To follow along, create a project directory using VS Code or any preferred editor.
- Initialize a basic project within this directory using `npm init -y`.
- Create an "API" directory within the project directory and add an `index.js` file inside it.

# [10:26](https://youtu.be/v88C0jL8pTQ?t=626) Installing Dependencies

Section Overview: This section explains how to install necessary dependencies for working with Solana and Grok.

## Dependency Installation

- Install Solana and Grok dependencies locally using npm or yarn.
# [12:59](https://youtu.be/v88C0jL8pTQ?t=779) Setting up the Default Function

Section Overview: In this section, the focus is on exporting a default function titled "Handler" that takes a request and a response. The goal is to console.log that the function is handling a request and log out the request method.

## Exporting Default Function

- The convention is to export a default function named "Handler" that takes a request and a response.
- Console.log that the function is handling a request and log out the request method.
- Return a response for both GET and POST requests with status 200 in JSON format.

# [14:02](https://youtu.be/v88C0jL8pTQ?t=842) Running the Server Locally

Section Overview: This section covers running the server locally using `npx first-so-dev` command. It also verifies if the server is working by accessing `localhost/api` endpoint.

## Running Local Server

- Use `npx first-so-dev` command to run the server locally.
- Access `localhost/api` endpoint to verify if it returns an empty JSON response.
- Check console logs to confirm that requests are being handled correctly.

# [15:07](https://youtu.be/v88C0jL8pTQ?t=907) Exposing Local Server via External URL

Section Overview: Here, we use NGROK to expose our local port via an external URL. This step is necessary for testing our Solana pay endpoint, as it needs to hit our server when scanning QR codes from mobile wallets.

## Exposing Local Server

- Run NGROK in another terminal session to expose local port via an external URL.
- Obtain the external URL provided by NGROK for accessing our local server.
- Update code with this external URL in place of localhost/api endpoint.
- Verify that hitting this new URL still returns an empty JSON response and logs requests correctly.

# [16:06](https://youtu.be/v88C0jL8pTQ?t=966) Setting Up QR Code for Local Development Server

Section Overview: This section focuses on setting up a QR code that points to the local development server. The QR code is created using the "QR code styling" library and should conform to the Solana P spec.

## Creating QR Code

- Use the "QR code styling" library to create a QR code.
- Copy the URL obtained from NGROK, including the "/api" endpoint.
- Ensure that the URL used in the QR code is prefixed with "Solana:" as per Solana P spec.
- Test scanning the QR code with a mobile wallet to ensure it shows the correct information.

# [17:39](https://youtu.be/v88C0jL8pTQ?t=1059) Completing API Endpoint for Solana P Spec

Section Overview: In this section, we modify our API endpoint to conform to the Solana P spec. Currently, it only returns an empty JSON response, which is not useful. We add a GET handler and prepare for handling POST requests in future.

## Modifying API Endpoint

- Create a GET handler function that takes a response and returns a status 200 JSON response with label and icon.
- Update existing code to include console logs only for sanity check purposes.
- If request method is GET, return handle get function with response as parameter.
- For now, if request method is not GET (i.e., POST), return an error message.

Note: The transcript does not provide further details beyond this point.
# [20:19](https://youtu.be/v88C0jL8pTQ?t=1219) Testing the Endpoint

Section Overview: The speaker discusses different ways to test the endpoint, either by accessing it through a browser or scanning a QR code with a wallet like Phantom.

## Testing Options

- Access the endpoint in a browser by appending "/API" to the URL.
- Scan the QR code with a compatible wallet like Phantom.

# [20:44](https://youtu.be/v88C0jL8pTQ?t=1244) Handling GET Requests

Section Overview: The speaker explains that when scanning the QR code on a mobile device, both GET and POST requests are sent to the server. However, only software like Scan will display UI widgets with correct labels and icons.

## GET Request Handling

- When scanning the QR code, GET requests can be observed on the server.
- UI widgets may not appear on mobile wallets, but software like Scan should display them correctly.

# [21:32](https://youtu.be/v88C0jL8pTQ?t=1292) Creating POST Response

Section Overview: The speaker introduces handling POST requests and logging out account information from the request body. A response is scaffolded with status 200 and a placeholder transaction.

## Handling POST Requests

- Create a function called `handlePost` that takes both request and response as parameters.
- Log out account information from `request.body.account`.
- Scaffold response with status 200 and placeholder transaction.
- Add an `else if` condition for POST requests (in all caps).

# [23:14](https://youtu.be/v88C0jL8pTQ?t=1394) Validating POST Requests

Section Overview: The speaker mentions that proper validation checks should be implemented for account presence. A temporary trick using VS Code's `@tscheck` comment is used to type-check JavaScript code.

## Validating Account Presence

- Implement validation checks to ensure account presence (not shown in example).
- Use VS Code's `@tscheck` comment to perform type-checking.

# [24:01](https://youtu.be/v88C0jL8pTQ?t=1441) Routing Requests

## Request Routing

- GET requests are routed to the `handleGet` function.
- POST requests are routed to the `handlePost` function.
- Other methods are currently not allowed.

# [24:23](https://youtu.be/v88C0jL8pTQ?t=1463) Building Handle Post Function

Section Overview: The speaker starts building the `handlePost` function by creating a player object using the account from the request. A placeholder instruction and transaction are also scaffolded.

## Creating Handle Post Function

- Create a player object using `new PublicKey(request.body.account)`.
- Scaffold a placeholder instruction called `createCthuluInstruction`, which requires the player parameter.
- Scaffold a placeholder transaction preparation function called `prepareTransaction`, which requires the Cthulhu instruction parameter.

# [25:36](https://youtu.be/v88C0jL8pTQ?t=1536) Finalizing Handle Post Function

Section Overview: The speaker summarizes the steps required to get the correct transaction in the handle post function. The necessary components include obtaining the public key, creating a Cthulhu instruction, and preparing the transaction with base64 encoding.

## Finalizing Handle Post Function

- Obtain public key using `new PublicKey(request.body.account)`.
- Create Cthulhu instruction using player account.
- Prepare transaction by encoding it with base64.
- Use temporary trick with VS Code's `@tscheck` comment for type-checking JavaScript code.

- Instructions need to be constructed manually when not using Anchor.
- The ID for the Seven Seas program should not be forgotten while creating instructions.
- A new transaction instruction is returned.

Note: Timestamps have been associated with bullet points where available.
# [35:25](https://youtu.be/v88C0jL8pTQ?t=2125) Setting up Keys and Data Property

Section Overview: In this section, the speaker discusses the keys and data property required for the program.

## Keys
- The order of the keys is important as it follows the Katula instruction.
- The first key needed is the chest vault, with `isWritable` set to true and `isSigner` set to false.
- The second key is the level, with `isWritable` set to true and `isSigner` set to false.
- The third key is the game actions, with `isWritable` set to false and `isSigner` set to false.
- Next is the player, with `isWritable` set to true and it must be a signer.
- Then comes the player's token account, with `isWritable` set to true and `isSigner` set to false.
- After that is the system program ID, with `isWritable` and `isSigner` both set to false.
- Following that is another instance of the player, with `isWritable` set to false.
- Then we have the player's token account owner PDAID, with `isWritable` set to true and `isSigner` set to false.
- Next is the token vault, with `isWritable` set to true and `isSigner` set to false.
- Lastly, we have the token mint from SBO token library, with both `isWritable` and `isSigner` being false.

## Data Property
- The data property specifies which instruction in the program needs to be called along with any related data for that instruction. 
- A rudimentary approach has been used here by copying from a prepared buffer. Refactoring will be done later using Anchor.

# [41:13](https://youtu.be/v88C0jL8pTQ?t=2473) Anchor Discriminator and Instruction

Section Overview: The speaker discusses the anchor discriminator and passing data to the function.

- The anchor discriminator is used to determine which function in the program needs to be called.
- There are multiple ways to obtain the anchor discriminator, but a more rudimentary approach is used here.
- The actual buffer for the instruction is copied from a prepared earlier version.
- Refactoring will be done later to demonstrate a general approach using Anchor.

# [42:31](https://youtu.be/v88C0jL8pTQ?t=2551) Prepare Transaction Function

Section Overview: The speaker explains the prepare transaction function.

- The prepare transaction function takes an instruction and returns the desired transaction.
- To create a new transaction, `new Transaction` from web3.js is used.
- The instruction is added to the transaction using `transaction.add`.
- Properties are set on the transaction, starting with `recentBlockHash`, obtained using `connection.getLatestBlockHash`.

# [43:00](https://youtu.be/v88C0jL8pTQ?t=2580) Completing Prepare Transaction Function

Section Overview: The speaker continues explaining how to complete the prepare transaction function.

- An async function is required for this step as it involves awaiting `connection.getLatestBlockHash`.
- After obtaining the recent block hash, other properties of the transaction can be set.
# [44:12](https://youtu.be/v88C0jL8pTQ?t=2652) Setting up the Transaction

Section Overview: In this section, the speaker explains how to set up a transaction and handle the fee payer.
