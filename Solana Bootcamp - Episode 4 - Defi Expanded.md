# [06:03](https://youtu.be/GyDSzUdv4u8?t=363) Understanding Pools and the Constant Product Algorithm

Section Overview: In this section, the speaker explains the concept of pools in decentralized exchanges (DEX) and introduces the constant product algorithm (K). The goal is to maintain a constant value of K while allowing asset swaps between users.

## Pools and Assets

- A pool consists of various assets with different quantities.
- The total quantity of any asset in the pool multiplied by each other gives a large product called K.
- Trades on a DEX aim to keep the value of K constant or within a tight margin.

## Nominal Quantity

- Q represents the total quantity of an asset, considering decimal places.
- Token accounts have balances with decimal places, so nominal quantity factors in these decimals.

## Swapping Assets

- Swapping involves offering one asset (P) to receive another asset (R).
- The smart contract calculates how much R should be received based on what is offered (P).
- The liquidity in the pool determines the amount of R received, not its price.

## Constant Product Algorithm

- The formula for calculating R based on P and current quantities in the pool is derived through algebraic manipulation.
- This formula represents the constant product algorithm used by smart contracts in DEXs.
- By inputting a value for P, we can obtain a corresponding value for R using this algorithm.

## Balances in the Pool

- QP and QR represent the current quantities of assets P and R in the pool.
- The equation derived from manipulation allows us to calculate the desired quantity of asset R based on the offered quantity of asset P.

## Implementation in Smart Contracts

- The constant product algorithm, obtained through algebraic manipulation, can be coded into smart contracts.
- By knowing the current quantities (QP and QR) and offering a value for P, we can determine the corresponding value for R using this algorithm.

# [11:43](https://youtu.be/GyDSzUdv4u8?t=703) Conclusion and Application

Section Overview: In this final section, the speaker concludes by summarizing how to set up and use the constant product algorithm. They emphasize that understanding algebraic manipulation is crucial for implementing this algorithm in smart contracts.

## Setting Up the Algorithm

- Algebraic manipulation is used to derive an equation that calculates the desired output (R) based on inputs (P) and current quantities (QP and QR).
- This equation represents the constant product algorithm used in DEXs.

## Coding Implementation

- The derived formula can be implemented into smart contracts to facilitate asset swaps within pools.
- By providing values for P, users can determine how much of asset R they will receive based on liquidity in the pool.

## Importance of Mathematics

- Checking math calculations is essential when working with algorithms like this.
- Understanding algebraic manipulation helps ensure accurate implementation in smart contracts.
